# CineMate

**CineMate** is a SwiftUI-based iOS app that lets users browse, filter, and save movies using The Movie Database (**TMDB**) API.  
It uses **MVVM architecture**, clean SwiftUI views, and a modular structure with previews, mocking, and secure API access.  
**Planned support for Google Sign-In via Firebase Authentication.**

> **Recommended setup:** Xcode **15.3** + iOS **17.4** (simulator or real device)

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the app, you need two local configuration files:

| File | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `Secrets.plist` | `CineMate/Secrets.plist` | Stores your TMDB API keys |
| `GoogleService-Info.plist` | `CineMate/GoogleService-Info.plist` | Firebase configuration for Google Sign-In *(planned)* |

> These files are **ignored in Git** to protect your secrets. Use the provided `Secrets.example.plist` as a reference.

---

## üîê Secrets & Security

These files are listed in `.gitignore` and protected by `.github/CODEOWNERS`:

- `Secrets.plist`
- `GoogleService-Info.plist` *(planned use with Firebase)*

This ensures sensitive data is never committed to GitHub, even by mistake.

> üõ°Ô∏è **Note:** `Secrets.plist` was accidentally committed earlier in development.  
> In **June 2025**, the full Git history was sanitized using [`git-filter-repo`](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo) to ensure no sensitive data remains in any commit.
> Only `Secrets.example.plist` remains for safe local use.

---

## Project Setup (Xcode)

### 1 ‚Äî Add `Secrets.plist`

1. Open project in **Xcode 15.3**
2. In **CineMate** folder ‚Üí right-click ‚Üí **New File‚Ä¶ ‚Üí Property List**
3. Name it `Secrets.plist`
4. Open as **Source Code** and paste:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
<key>TMDB_API_KEY</key>
<string>PUT-YOUR-API-KEY-HERE</string>
<key>TMDB_BEARER_TOKEN</key>
<string>PUT-YOUR-BEARER-TOKEN-HERE</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

### 2 ‚Äî Add `GoogleService-Info.plist` *(optional for now)*

1. Go to **Firebase Console ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Your Apps**
2. Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist`
3. Drag it into your **CineMate** folder in Xcode
4. Tick **"Copy if needed"**

## Architecture & Concepts

- MVVM (Model‚ÄìView‚ÄìViewModel)
- **Simple Dependency Injection** (init-based, no factories)
- Repository Pattern for data abstraction
- Generic service layer for TMDB endpoints
- Preview-friendly setup using `MockMovieRepository` and `PreviewData`
- Secure API key management with `Secrets.plist` (ignored in Git)
- `.gitignore` and `.github/CODEOWNERS` for professional repo hygiene
- SwiftUI-only app using async/await and modern view composition
- Feature-first folder structure (Movies, People, Lists)
- SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) and SoC (Separation of Concerns)
- Icons sourced from [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/)
- Planned support for Firebase Authentication (Google Sign-In)


---

## Running the App

1. Select a simulator running iOS 17.4 (e.g. iPhone 15)
2. Press **Cmd + R** or click ‚ñ∂Ô∏è to build & run

## Portfolio Notes

This app is part of my iOS development portfolio. It demonstrates:

- Real-world API handling (TMDB)
- Secure API key management
- UI/UX considerations with empty state views and genre filtering
- Professional GitHub setup (CODEOWNERS, branch protection, secrets ignored)
- Consideration for advanced patterns like Dependency Injection, SRP, and SoC
- ‚≠êÔ∏è If you find CineMate useful or inspiring, feel free to leave a star on GitHub ‚Äî every bit of support is appreciated.

> This project is still evolving ‚Äî new features and improvements are added continuously.

## Folder Structure

The CineMate project follows a modular architecture with feature-based separation, MVVM, and reusable components.

## üîê Google Sign-In Overview *(planned)*

> Support for Firebase Authentication is in progress.  
> Below is a code example showing how sign-in will work:

```swift
let credential = GoogleAuthProvider.credential(
withIDToken: idToken,
accessToken: accessToken
)
Auth.auth().signIn(with: credential) { result, error in
// Signed in to Firebase
}
```
